## 🎨 Overview & Design Architecture

MediNexa coordinates clinical records, patient documents, and lab reports under a unified data backend. Unlike traditional designs where files are sandboxed on multiple servers, MediNexa uses **MongoDB GridFS** as its singular secure repository.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. My Health Documents
A secure storage and retrieval sandbox that handles patients' files. All files are stored directly inside **MongoDB GridFS**:
*   **Zero-Firestore Patient Sandbox**: All patient records and personal documents are stored in MongoDB GridFS, removing all read/write/listener operations on Firestore subcollections (`users/{uid}/documents` and `users/{uid}/reports`) to prevent security and permission gaps.
*   **Metadata Single Source of Truth**: Document properties such as size, MIME content-type, original filename, upload time, and category name are stored directly in MongoDB's `storage_metadata` collection.
*   **Automatic Category Formatting**: The user interface scans document names for keywords to dynamically categorize and assign premium typography and custom emojis:
    *   🩺 `Previous Prescription`
    *   🖼 `MRI Scan` / `CT Scans`
    *   📄 `Insurance Card` / `ID Cards`
    *   🩸 `Blood Test` / `Lab Reports`

### 2. Laboratory & Medical Reports
A secure laboratory portal and doctor review dashboard where laboratories can upload PDF reports directly for a patient.
*   **Doctor Review Panel**: Doctors can dynamically view actual reports uploaded by laboratories. If no reports exist, a placeholder message appears.
*   **AI Summary Independent**: Standard AI-generated report summaries are separated and kept distinct from the primary "Lab & Medical Reports" storage dashboard.
*   **Lab Name Resolution**: Resolves and displays the uploading laboratory name dynamically by fetching matching user records from Firestore.

### 3. Medoc Analyze
Our universal medical document analyzer automatically classifies and parses 5 different types of medical documents:
*   **Prescription**: Extracts doctor details, patient name, date, diagnosis, and fully structured medicines list.
*   **Laboratory Report**: Extracts abnormal test parameters, reference ranges, and provides Gen-Z Hinglish explanations (e.g., `💡 Khoon ki kami indicate karta hai.`).
*   **Medical Bill**: Extracts billing items, hospital name, and billing summary.
*   **Discharge Summary**: Summarizes treatment history, medications, and follow-ups.
*   **Unknown Document**: Displays a warning card if the document isn't recognized.

### 4. AI Chatbot
Interactive medical chatbot panel utilizing Gemini AI to query symptoms, medicine interactions, and nutritional guidance securely.

### 5. Advanced Authentication & UI Upgrades
*   **Mandatory Email Verification**: Prevents unverified registrations from polluting the database. Upon signup, users receive a verification link and are auto-signed out. The app verifies `emailVerified` on login, launching a premium glassmorphic verification dialog if verification is incomplete.
*   **Lazy Firestore Creation**: The Firestore user document is created only after the user's email has been verified and they log in for the first time.
*   **Secure Password Reset**: Built-in glassmorphic forgot password panel linked with Firebase `sendPasswordResetEmail()`.
*   **Premium Glassmorphic Theme & Accents**: Vibrant purple accents matched dynamically across light/dark modes with beautiful glowing Custom Paint background circles on dashboard cards.
*   **Responsive Login Layout**: Built with a flexible layout architecture that adapts beautifully to different device sizes and open soft keyboards, preventing vertical screen clipping.
*   **Sleek 3D App Icon**: Installed a premium custom 3D glowing shield launch icon for mobile configurations.

## 🛡️ Security & Access Authorization

To protect patient files from unauthorized access:
*   **Token-Based API Verification**: The backend verifies incoming Firebase ID tokens using the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
*   **Secure Patient Endpoint**: Patients retrieve their files via `GET /api/storage/patient` where the system resolves the patient's UID directly from the secure decoded JWT payload, preventing ID spoofing.
*   **Dual Appointment Check for Doctors**: Doctors are allowed to view patient documents and lab reports only if an active or completed appointment exists between them. The backend dynamically verifies this link by checking **MongoDB** first and falling back to **Firestore**'s `appointments` collection, preventing false-negative access blocks.
*   **Admins**: Enjoy full read access for auditing and platform management.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart), Google Fonts (Outfit, Inter), Syncfusion PDF Viewer
*   **Backend**: Python, Flask, PyTesseract (OCR Fallback)
*   **AI Engine**: Google Generative AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
*   **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (GridFS & Metadata), Firestore (User profiles & appointments)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Local Configuration

#### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/
   DB_NAME=medinexa
   FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=medinexa-cf258-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-f5ec0d9510.json
   GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your_gemini_key
   ```
5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

#### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Fetch Flutter packages:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Configure the correct base URL in `lib/config/api_config.dart`:
   ```dart
   static const String baseUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/api';
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### 2. Production/Render Deployment
For production hosting on platforms like **Render**:
1. Store your Firebase Admin credentials in `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` as a Base64-encoded string.
2. The code in `firebase_config.py` automatically detects and decodes the Base64 configuration at runtime, removing the need to upload credentials to GitHub.
3. Whitelist `0.0.0.0/0` in your MongoDB Atlas Network Access configuration.
